<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline3">About me</h2>

<p>I am a 15-year old who is interested in creating applications/websites that benefit the open-source community. I started programming about 3 years ago when I
  was browsing sites that were hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and came across the source code of one GitHub Page. Ever since that day, I have never stopped programming.</p>

<p>I am currently in my last year at School of Science & Technology, Singapore, about to get ready for the biggest exam of my 10+ years in education ever - O Levels which would begin in a few months.</p>

<p>So far, I have created a few side projects which are all open sourced on GitHub such as a <a href="https://github.com/EdricChan03/StudyBuddy-android">Study Buddy</a> or an <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> library for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/">YouTube Data v3 API</a>.</p>

<p>However, I'm mostly interested in creating small websites such as StudyBuddy for the web, this website the portfolio is on and the demo website for the Angular library I've previously stated above.</p>

<p>I use a 13-inch Early 2015 MacBook Pro as my primary and personal computer for my school and a Neffos C7 phone running Android Oreo for testing my Android applications on.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on my projects, I usually read programming and non-fiction books ranging from History to Science and English.</p>

<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline3">My LEAPS record</h2>

<h3 class="mdc-typography--headline4">Leadership</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 2018, at the start of the June Holidays, I attended the North-West
      Scout Leadership Course that taught me about the traits that a leader
      should possess, as well as developing my leadership styles and how to
      better manage my leadership power and influences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      From 2018 to 2019, I volunteered myself to be a House Representative so that I could lead my peers in House
      activities such as the Outdoor Education Expedition (OEE) in 2018 for Secondary 2s that my school organises every
      year for the other
      Secondary levels.
    </p>
    <p><em>
      Note: The purpose of OEE is to expose students to the outdoors and for a break from regular lessons in class.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      From this experience, I have learnt how to organise activities for my juniors. For example, in 2018 for OEE,
      instead of the teachers organising the event, they decided it was our turn to organise the event, but they would
      guide us along the way. The reason they gave us the task of organising the event was because they wanted us to
      experience what it was like to actually plan the whole event out before executing the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also learnt to always prepare for unforeseeable cirsumstances such as unexpected weather. For instance, in the same OEE which I helped to organise, we had to come up with a backup plan in case of wet weather. 
    </p>

<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline3">Co-Curricular Activities</h2>

<p>From Secondary 1 to the end of Semester 1 in Secondary 4, I joined Scouts which I put as 3rd choice over Media Club and Robotics.</p>

<p>I have since bonded with my juniors and made friends with peers of the same Secondary level as me.</p>
