This is a new form of blog post where I cover what I've done so far and plans for the following month. Expect to see this at the end of each month starting from February!

<!-- End of excerpt -->

## What I've done in February

- I've enabled [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) on most of my repositories. So far, it's much better than my previous setup involving Greenkeeper (which does not automatically resolve merge conflicts/rebase with the current project's files).
- I've created a few projects which include:
  - [Chan4077/actions](https://github.com/Chan4077/actions) - A list of GitHub Actions
- I've continued work on [Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api](https://github.com/Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api) including restructuring the library by extracting the core functionality to a `common` entry point, enabled [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) and added initial schematics (which are currently not committed).

## Plans for March

- Release of `1.0.0-alpha.5` for [Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api](https://github.com/Chan4077/ngx-ytd-api)
  - Bump to beta
  - Fix bugs
  - Full schematic support
- Update my website
  - New blog posts
  - Possible redesign of website
  - Support dark mode
- New release for [Chan4077/StudyBuddy](https://github.com/Chan4077/StudyBuddy)
- Initial API for [Chan4077/StudyBuddy-web](https://github.com/Chan4077/StudyBuddy-web)
  - Update the hosted website
  - TravisCI integration for automatic deploying
- Take a short break from programming
