  description: |
    An Angular app based on an example Angular app by [BeCompany GmbH](https://github.com/becompany/angular2-rss-reader-tutorial) and updated to
    the latest version of Angular.
    
    The app also includes features such as the ability for the user to specify
    a feed to be read into the RSS feed, as well as retrieving the headlines of a
    country and a refreshed interface. (The original app only had a list of cards which could be clicked on.)

    Unfortunately, work on the app has been temporarily ceased due to other
    projects and the lack of time.

  description: |
    An educational game made for the Singapore Chinese Centre of Learning Competition in 2017-2018 with two peers - Teo Wei Hao and Aakash Sanjay Mehtha.

    The app's purpose was to aid children in primary schools in their Chinese studies and was supported on Android and iOS.

    The project was submitted in late 2017 with a video showing how to play the game and a certificate of participation was awarded in late 2018.

    The source code of the two apps was archived on 23 Aug 2018. Development of the apps has been ceased.
