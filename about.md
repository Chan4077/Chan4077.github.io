# About me
{: .mdc-typography--headline2}

I'm a 15 year old Singaporean who's interested in IT. I've created a few side projects, as well as some big projects that has taken me a year or more. I currently own a Early 2015 MacBook Pro that I store my projects on.

Currently, I study at [School of Science & Technology, Singapore](https://www.sst.edu.sg).

When I'm not working on my projects, I read programming books, as well as non-fiction educational books.

## Programming experience

So far, it's been about _2 years_ since I got my hands on programming.

That was on a trip to London where I decided to create an account on GitHub.

And that was how it all started.
