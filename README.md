Website @ https://chan4077.github.io

I am trying to use ~~[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) in this website and there is also~~ [Angular](https://angularjs.org).
> Unfortunately, it appears that [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) has moved to this [page](https://material.io/components.html) where the source code is at [material-components/material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
> Therefore, I will be permanently updating the site to use [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org)

There too, is [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest)!
